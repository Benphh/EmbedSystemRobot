# EmbedSystemRobot
The 2 parts of the project for Embedded Systems: straight line and cube solving
Pins:


Straight Line:
    Has two different motors, a slave(slower) and master(faster)
    they have two different variables for speed that are the same
    the difference in the ticks is then figured out then multiplied by a set variable then added to the slave speed


Cube Solving
    goes straight
    when it senses somthing in front of the sensor it spins by 90 degrees
    this happens 4 times, then it spins by 45 degrees and moves forward
